<h1 class="english" style="text-align: center; color: red;">The Story About Me and My Confidant</h1>

<p class="english">Six years ago, a blood-sucking undead creature as well as a mortal scientist headed for the Pingtung branch of Pacific SOGO Department Stores. When the blood-sucking undead creature and the mortal scientist reached the location of the department store, a mutated human also arrived there by bicycle. Then the blood-sucking undead creature, the mortal scientist, and the mutated human went into the department store for lunch. This is where the whole story began.
    <br>
    <br>

    <div style="background-color: black; color: white;">
    <strong>
    Note:<br>1. The mortal scientist came from Marvel Comics, graduated from the doctoral program in the Department of Electrical Engineering of Massachusetts Institute of Technology, had deep understanding of scientific knowledge and technology, and equipped himself with red-yellow-inlaid armor he invented. This armor could launch micro missiles from its shoulders to kill enemies and at the same time avoid hurting the innocent who were held hostages by them, release heated red lasers from its sleeves to cut materials and weld metals, emit dense yellowish white energy beams from its palms and heart to destroy giant buildings, absorb his enemy’s electricity attack through the arc reactor which had been installed on his heart, fly at the speed of Mach five in the air, produce approximately twenty five tons of strength, and use its artificial intelligence which was called “Friday” to analyze his enemy’s style of combat and then make corresponding counterattacks. Besides, this armor also enabled its wearer to survive high temperature, cold environment, and vacuum state. Therefore, the mortal scientist’s fans called him “a mortal body rivaling gods”.<br><br>2. The mutated human also came from Marvel Comics, was called “Super Soldier”, had been injected with special serum and then become able to jump three meters high in the air, run over one kilometer within one minute, and lift up five hundred and forty five kilograms when doing “Bench Press”, held a shield which was comprised by a kind of metal named “Vibranium”, slept for seventy years after succeeding in stopping Red Skull from conquering the world during World War Two, and mastered some typical martial arts like Taekwondo, Karate, Muay Thai, Judo, Brazilian Jiujitsu, Aikido, Krav Maga, Boxing, and Extreme Martial Arts. His metabolism was fourt times as fast as that of a normal human, the shield with which he was equipped could absorb various kinds of attacks and shock waves, and his most famous quote in comics and movies was, “I can do this all day.”<br><br>3. Unlike the mortal scientist and the mutated human, the blood-sucking undead creature came from Chinese folklore, looked no different from a human in appearance, had died one time in the earlier past, but became alive again after absorbing resentment and bad luck between sky and earth, owned cold skin as well as indestructible body, was immune to most physical attacks like stabbing, shooting, and bombing, could absorb moonlight at night to strengthen its power, was able to recover at the speed visible to naked eyes after getting wounded, and could stay immortal, because “Heaven”, “Hell”, and “Mortal World”, which are the so-called “Three Worlds”, excluded it from Six Classes of Beings. Thus, this blood-sucking undead creature relied on resentment as its power, fed on blood, and kept sucking all living beings’ blood to vent the endless solitude inside its heart. At first this blood-sucking undead creature could only move by jumping, couldn’t speak, was unable to see anything, and could only find the location of its preys by detecting their breath, so when they stopped breathing, it couldn’t find where they were. Besides, it had to extend its arms forward and straight while jumping. Nevertheless, after it cultivated itself for five centuries, it upgraded to a monster called “Han Ba”(The Chinese characters are written as “旱魃”), and still looked no different from a human in appearance, yet was able to see, walk, run, think, and even speak, had blood-red eyes, could run very fast like lightning, was able to jump one hundred meters high with ease, was capable of lifting up things hundreds of times heavier than itself, was able to carry a heavy object such as a human on its back and at the same time move as fast as a sports car or jump tens of meters high, had various kinds of supernatural powers, such as levitating in the air, flying, summoning ghosts from hell, manipulating corpses(Namely, manipulating its compatriots), controlling weather and then calling lightning from the cloud, and so on, and most importantly was capable of bringing drought and plague to a village of humans. After this blood-sucking undead creature had cultivated itself for another five centuries and survived Heavenly Thunder Tribulation, it upgraded from “旱魃” to a divine beast that looked like a dog, was dubbed “Hou”(The Chinese character is written as “犼”), got tamed by Guanyin Bodhisattva, then became her mount, was capable of releasing flame from its mouth, and could fly supersonically. According to the description in an ancient Chinese novel called “Zi Bu Yu”(The Chinese characters are written as “子不語”), this divine beast was the final and mightiest form of this blood-sucking undead creature. Besides, legend has it that “犼”’s staple was dragons, which tells us how mighty and dangerous this divine beast was in Chinese mythology, even Sun Wukong had difficulty beating it, and only Guanyin Bodhisattva had the ability to suppress it. Therefore, the sculpture of Guanyin Bodhisattva riding this divine beast appears in some sightseeing spots that are known for eastern religions, including Tsz Shan Monastery Buddhist Art Museum located in Hong Kong, a few daoist temples scattered throughout Taiwan, and Southern Branch of National Palace Museum located in Chiayi County. Therefore, when the mortal scientist was using his cellphone to record both of the mutated human and the blood-sucking undead creature sprint on the playground of an elementary school in Pingtung City, the blood-sucking undead creature left the mutated human far behind and then won the race easily. However, this blood-sucking undead creature wasn’t invincible. Actually, weapons filled with the bright energy called “Solar Aura”, such as glutinous rice, mahogany swords, black dog's blood, rooster's blood, and the urine of a man who hadn’t lost his virginity, were this blood-sucking undead creature’s nemeses, because its body was made from the dark energy called “Yin Qi” in Mandarin, which was like Holy Water and silverware could combust Romania’s Count Dracula’s skin. Also, when a yellow daoism talisman got affixed to this blood-sucking undead creature’s forehead, it couldn’t move, for this kind of talisman could seal its consciousness, just like Romania’s Count Dracula couldn’t avoid feeling mentally tortured in front of a crucifix and a holy bible. To put it simply, this blood-sucking undead creature from China and Count Dracula from Romania were the same essentially, and the only difference was that they arose from different religious systems, so crucifixes, holy bibles, holy water, and silverware didn’t work to this blood-sucking undead creature, but glutinous rices, mahogany swords, black dog blood, rooster's blood, and the urine of a man who hadn’t lost his virginity were able to corrode the skin of this blood-sucking undead creature, while yellow daoism talismans could deprive it of its consciousness.

    After satisfying our appetite with mouthwatering Thai cuisine on the first basement floor of the department store, we three went to the elementary school where Tony Stark and I stayed for whole six years. When Steve Rogers and Tony Stark swore on the playground to protect the world together, I took a series of pictures of them shaking hands and drinking beer, and recorded a video in which they swore to fight against Thanos, and then Steve Rogers became a formal member of Avengers. Avengers was founded by Tony Stark, comprised more than four heroes, and took responsibility for keeping the world from being polluted by wickedness. Under Avengers’ protection, the world had kept peaceful and safe for a long time, and when I sent Steve Rogers a book called “New Elementary Japanese Language”, he happily tagged me in his post publicly on Facebook to inform everyone that he got along well with this team’s other members. Thus, it is no exaggeration to say that Steve Rogers was kind and valued friendship very much.
    <br>

    </div>
    <br>
    <br>
    Unfortunately, one day Steve Rogers wanted to play with Tony Stark and kept touching his shoulder with his forefinger, totally unaware that Tony Stark had been offended by his behavior. Thus, Tony Stark pushed him down, and then Steve Rogers angrily counterattacked him and punched his eye. From that day on, Steve Rogers has never visited us because he was kicked out of Avengers the very next day. Avengers used to be made up of over four members and was a powerful team. Yet today it is composed of only two members, who are respectively Tony Stark and me, because all of the other members were kicked out of this team owing to their awful quality. The feeling of losing friends is painful, but it is a process that everyone must undergo. I used to be convinced that the more friends someone had, the more protected he became, but the truth is that the more friends someone has, the more likely he is to become a loser. Nine years ago I joined Avengers, and I was also the first one to be added in. To strengthen this team in the days to come, I tried to invite as many people as possible to join in, but later I came to realize that only Tony Stark and I can be accepted by Avengers. To put it another way, only Tony Stark and I have been the true members of Avengers from beginning to end, while all of the other guys were nothing but temporary passersby.
    <br>
    <br>
    By the way, the book which is called “New Elementary Japanese Language” and was given to Steve Rogers as a gift had been bought when I became a tenth grader because it was used as textbook by my Japanese language teacher at school. However, the content written in this book was so easy that it could no longer satisfy me, so I decided to send it to Steve Rogers so as to enable him to study Japanese. At that time I needed new books which provide readers with more complicated grammar and more vocabularies. Otherwise, I would not have succeeded in acquiring the certification of Japanese Language Proficiency Test N3 the year before last year.

    <br>
    In conclusion, having undergone countless separations and filtrations, only Tony Stark has kept in touch with me until now. He has been my best friend for the past nineteen years. We had been classmates for four years before grade five. We have many common hobbies, and our personalities are very similar. We both love heroes from Marvel Universe and DC Universe, and we are also fond of Uncle Nine and his disciples from Hongkong horror films. Nonetheless, I haven’t seen Tony Stark in real life for one year though his residence is approximately two thousand seven hundred meters away from mine, and this is not that far. The last time I saw Tony Stark was the beginning of last year, and at that time we should have met outside Pingtung City Office but I didn’t see him there because we planned to attend the flag raising ceremony but he overslept. However, this didn’t cause any loss at all, because I succeeded in recording the talent show we had been looking forward to watching during the ceremony, and then uploaded it to our LINE Notepad. Therefore, we changed to meet at a brunch shop called “six inch plate” and then went back to the campus where Steve Rogers had been declared a formal member of Avengers six years ago. On the playground Tony Stark recorded me perform <a href="https://www.facebook.com/share/v/1BqSF8qrqJ/" target="_blank">standing long jump</a>, flying kick, and spinning back kick. Besides, I also tried to jump onto the reviewing stand alongside the playground by jumping and without using my hands to support my body, and I succeeded every time, which meant my legs’ explosive strength was very strong. However, the campus had changed a lot, because not only the runway for inline skating but also some typical amusement rides, like double spiral slide, seesaw, and plane-shaped climbing frame, were gone, and the color of the playground also turned blue from red and green. Now I don’t know when I will be able to see Tony Stark in real life again……

    <h1 style="text-align: center; color: red;">我和我知己的故事</h1>
<p>六年前，一隻吸血的不死生物以及凡人科學家前往太平洋SOGO百貨屏東分店。當吸血的不死生物和凡人科學家抵達百貨公司的位置時，一隻突變的人類也騎著腳踏車抵達。然後吸血的不死生物、凡人科學家、突變的人類進百貨公司吃午餐，這就是整個故事的開始。
    <br>
    <br>

    <div style="background-color: black; color: white;">
    <strong>
    註：<br>一、凡人科學家來自漫威漫畫，畢業於麻省理工學院電氣工程系博士課程，深入瞭解科學知識與技術，並配備自己發明的紅黃色鑲嵌盔甲。這款盔甲可從肩膀發射微型導彈來殺死敵人同時避免傷害被他們持有人質的無辜者、從袖子上釋放加熱的紅色激光來切割材料和焊接金屬、從手心和心臟發射出密集的黃白色能量光束來破壞巨型建築物、透過安裝在他心上的圓弧反應堆吸收敵人的電力攻擊、以五馬赫的速度飛行在空中、產生約二十五噸的力量、利用它被稱為「星期五」的人工智能分析敵人的作戰風格然後做出相應的反擊。此外，這款盔甲也使其佩戴者能夠在高溫、寒冷環境和真空狀態中存活。因此，凡人科學家的粉絲稱他為「凡人之軀比肩神明」。<br><br>二、突變的人類也來自漫威漫畫，被稱為「超級士兵」，被注入特殊血清後能在空中跳三米高、在一分鐘內跑完一公里、在做握推時舉起五百四十五公斤，手持由一種名為「汎合金」的金屬組成的盾牌，在二戰期間成功阻止紅骷髏征服世界後睡了七十年，並且掌握了一些典型的武術，像是跆拳道、空手道、泰拳、柔道、巴西柔術、合氣道、以色列馬伽術、拳擊和極限武術。他的新陳代謝速度是正常人類的四倍，配備的盾牌可以吸收各種攻擊和震波，而他在漫畫和電影中最著名的名言是：「我可以和你耗一整天。」<br><br>三、不同於凡人科學家與突變的人類，吸血的不死生物來自中國民間傳說，外貌與人類無異，早前曾死過一次，卻在吸收天地之間的怨氣與晦氣後重新活過來，擁有冰冷的皮膚以及堅不可摧的身體，對刺、砍、射擊、爆炸等多數物理攻擊免疫，能吸收夜間的月光來增強其力量，受傷後能以肉眼可見的速度恢復，能長生不老，因為天、地、人三界將它摒棄在眾生六道之外。因此，這種吸血的不死生物以怨為力、以血為食，用眾生鮮血宣洩無盡的孤寂。起初這種吸血的不死生物只能透過跳躍來移動，無法言語，什麼都看不到，只能透過偵測呼吸找到獵物的位置，所以當他們停止呼吸時它就找不到他們在哪裡，而且它跳躍時還要向前伸直手臂。然而，在它修煉了五個世紀之後，它進化為一隻叫「旱魃」的怪物，外貌還是與人類無異，卻能看、能走、能跑、能思考，甚至能說話，眼睛是血紅色的，跑得快如閃電，能輕鬆跳上百米高，能舉起比自己重數百倍的東西，能背著人類等重物同時移動得快如跑車或跳躍數十米高，有各種超自然能力像是懸浮在空中、飛行、召喚地府的鬼魂、操縱屍體（即操縱其同類）、控制天氣然後從雲中呼喚閃電等，最重要的是有能力給人類村莊帶來旱災和瘟疫。這隻吸血的不死生物又修煉了五個世紀並且成功渡過天雷劫後，它從「旱魃」升級為一隻看起來像狗的神獸，被稱為「犼」，被觀世音菩薩馴服然後成為她的坐騎，可以從嘴裡噴出火焰並超音速飛翔。根據中國古代小說《子不語》的記載，犼是這種吸血的不死生物的最終和最強大的形態。此外，傳說中犼以龍為食，這告訴我們這隻神獸在中國神話中是多麼的強大和危險，連孫悟空都難以擊敗它，只有觀世音菩薩有能力鎮壓它。因此，觀世音菩薩騎這尊神獸的雕塑出現在一些以東方宗教聞名的觀光景點，包括位於香港的慈山寺佛教藝術館、少數散佈於台灣各地的道教寺廟，以及位於台灣嘉義縣的故宮博物院南部分院。因此，當凡人科學家用手機錄影突變的人類與吸血的不死生物在屏東市某小學操場衝刺時，吸血的不死生物將突變的人類遠遠拋在腦後然後輕鬆贏得比賽。然而，這種吸血的不死生物並不是無敵的。實際上，充滿了名為「陽氣」的明亮能量的武器，比如糯米、桃木劍、黑狗血、公雞血、童子尿，就是這種吸血的不死生物的克星，因為它的身體是由一種名為陰氣的暗能量組成的，這種情況就像聖水和銀器可以灼傷羅馬尼亞的德古拉伯爵的皮膚。此外，當黃色的符咒貼在這種吸血的不死生物的額頭上時，它就無法動彈，因為符咒可以封存它的意識，就像羅馬尼亞的德古拉伯爵也無法避免在十字架和聖經面前感到精神折磨一樣。簡單來說，這種來自中國的吸血不死生物和來自羅馬尼亞的德古拉伯爵本質上是相同的，唯一的區別是，它們來自不同的信仰體系，所以十字架、聖經、聖水和銀器對這種吸血不死生物來說沒有用，但糯米、桃木劍、黑狗血、公雞血以及童子尿能夠腐蝕這種吸血的不死生物的皮膚，而黃色的符咒則可以剝奪其意識。

    在百貨公司地下一樓吃了令人垂涎欲滴的泰式料理滿足口腹之慾後，我們三人去了我和托尼·史塔克待了整整六年的小學。當史蒂夫·羅傑斯和托尼·史塔克在操場上發誓要一起守護世界時，我拍了一系列他們握手喝啤酒的照片並錄製了一段他們發誓要對抗薩諾斯的視訊，接著史蒂夫·羅傑斯成為復仇者聯盟的正式成員。復仇者聯盟由托尼·斯塔克創立，由四位以上英雄組成並負起防止世界被邪惡污染的責任。在復仇者聯盟的保護下，世界長期保持和平與安全，而當我送史蒂夫·羅傑斯一本叫做「新初級日語」的書時，他開心地在臉書公開的貼文中標記了我來告訴大家他與這個團隊的其他成員相處融洽。因此，毫不誇張地說，史蒂夫·羅傑斯的本性是善良的且非常重視友誼。
    <br>
    <div style="text-align:center; background-color: red;">
    <img width="600" height="1200" src="攝影.jpg" alt="攝影：將臣">
    </div>
    <br>
    <br>
    但不幸的是，某天史蒂夫·羅傑斯想和托尼·史塔克玩耍並一直用他的食指摸他的肩膀，完全不知道托尼·史塔克被他的行為冒犯了。於是，托尼·斯塔克把他推倒，然後史蒂夫·羅傑斯憤怒地反擊他並打了他的眼睛。從那天起，史蒂夫·羅傑斯從未拜訪過我們，因為第二天他被趕出復仇者聯盟。復仇者聯盟曾經由超過四個成員組成，是一個強大的隊伍。然而今天只有兩位成員，分別是托尼·斯塔克和我，因為其他成員都因為他們的品行不佳而被趕出這個團隊。失去朋友的感覺很痛苦，卻是每個人都必須經歷的過程。我曾經深信，朋友越多，就越受保護，但事實是，朋友越多，就越容易成為失敗者。九年前我加入復仇者聯盟，也是第一個被加入的。為了在未來的日子裡強化這個團隊，我試著邀請盡量多人加入，但後來我才知道，只有托尼·史塔克和我可以被復仇者聯盟接受。換個方式說，只有托尼·史塔克和我自始至終才是復仇者聯盟真正的成員，而其他人只是過客。
<br><br>
    順帶一提，這本被稱為「新初級日語」並送給史蒂夫·羅傑斯當禮物的書，是我高中一年級時買的，因為它被我學校的日文老師當成教科書使用。但這本書寫的內容簡單到無法再滿足我，所以我決定送給史蒂夫·羅傑斯以便讓他學習日文。當時我需要提供讀者更複雜的文法和更多詞彙的新書，不然前年我也不會成功取得日本語能力檢定N3的認證。

    <br>
    <br>
    總結，經歷了無數次的分離和過濾後，直到現在只有托尼·史塔克與我保持聯繫。過去十九年，他一直是我最好的朋友，升上小學五年級之前我們已經同班四年。我們有很多共同的嗜好，性格也很相似。我們都喜歡漫威宇宙和DC宇宙的英雄，也喜歡香港恐怖片裡的林正英和其徒弟。儘管如此，我已經有一年多沒有在現實中見過托尼·史塔克，雖然他的住所離我的住所大約兩千七百米，這距離沒有說特別很遠。 上次見到托尼·史塔克是去年初，當時我們應該在屏東市公所外面碰面，但我沒在那裡見到他，因為我們計劃參加升旗典禮，而他睡過頭了。不過這完全沒有造成任何損失，因為我成功錄製了我們期待在典禮中看的才藝表演然後上傳到我們的LINE記事本。因此，我們改到一家叫做「六吋盤」的早午餐店見面，然後回到六年前史蒂夫·羅傑斯被宣佈為復仇者聯盟正式成員的校園。在操場上，托尼·史塔克錄製了我表演<a href="https://www.facebook.com/share/v/1BqSF8qrqJ/" target="_blank">立定跳遠</a>、飛踢和後旋踢的影片。此外，我還試著跳躍到操場旁邊的司令台上，而且在沒有雙手支撐身體的情況下每次都成功，這意味著我的雙腿爆發力很強。但校園改變了很大——不僅是直排輪的跑道，還有一些典型的遊樂設施像是雙螺旋溜滑梯、蹺蹺板、飛機形的攀爬架都消失了，操場的顏色也從紅綠變成藍色。現在我不知道什麼時候才能再次看到托尼·史塔克......
